Quick Start
===========

This should be a very simple quick-start guide. Ideally it should be
succinct yet detailed enough that someone can quicky download and
install your package, and then run a quick calculation or example
within about 5-10 minutes. This quick-start will provide the motivation
to potential users that this package does work, and it is worth
working through the whole tutorial (or reading the documenation).

You have 5-10 minutes of someone's attention. Use it wisely.
