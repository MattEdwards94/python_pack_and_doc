Tutorial
========

This should be a detailed tutorial of all of the features of your package.
The philosophy of tutorial-driven development is that any feature that
is not described in the tutorial does not exist.

So please, do make sure that you provide tutorials that demonstrate all
of the features of your package.

Because this can get quite long, use the
:doc:`quickstart guide <../quickstart/index>` as the place to get
new users quickly up and running. This tutorial is for people who
already know they want to use your package, and who now need more
guidance and examples of how to use it.
